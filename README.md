# Fizz Buzz

## What is it?
Briefly speaking, it is a programming exercise adapted from a children's game. With some practice, interviewers can leverage it to evaluate a job candidate's fit for a position. 

### Goal
Understand what it might be like to work together


## Requirements
| In-person | Video conference |
|:---|:---|
| <ol><li>White board</li><li>Dry-erase marker</li></ol> | <ol><li>Candidate must join via a personal computer (PC) with a keyboard and multi-window display.</li><li>Candidate must have a simple text editor or optionally, an integrated development environment (IDE).</li><li>Candidate must be able to share a view of their text editor (so that interviewers can see it)</li></ol> |

## Conducting the interview
| | Description | Interviewer script | Notes |
|---|:---|:---|:---|
| Step&nbsp;1&nbsp; | Briefly explain the goal. Invite the candidate to participate in the exercise. | "I cannot reasonably hope to evaluate your coding skills under these circumstances, so we won't waste our time on that. Instead, I have an exercise to help us understand what it might be like to work together. Actually, it is a variation of the program called Fizz Buzz. Have you heard of it? Are you up for a 10-15 minute _collaborative_ coding exercise? | If someone declines, be sure to ask why. |
| Step 2 | Set the stage | Please go ahead and open a text editor and share so I can see what you type. For the next 15 minutes you and I are going to pretend to be teammates. I have some requirements to give you and our task is to work together and come up with a solution. Any questions before we start? My clock says 3:30 now, so let's give ourselves 15 minutes to discuss the requirements and write a solution. That means we'll wrap up at 3:45, ok? Let's get started | |
| Step 3 | Introduce requirements | | |
| Step 4 | Develop the solution together | | Optionally|
| Step 5 | Change the requirements | <ul><li>How could we make this more efficient?</li><li>What if the numbers are 3 and 5 instead of 2 and 3</li><li>How would you solve this without loops? Hint: This could be done with recursion</li><li>If our solution will be part of a library's public API, what are some things we should be concerned about? Hint: Input validation, thread-safety, etc.</li></ul> | Optionally, the interviewer may start this step just _before_ the code satisfies the initial requirements. This can be jarring, but we must be prepared to welcome change at any time.<br><br>This is an opportunity for the interviewer to exercise creativity. Invent a new requirement and throw it into the mix when it is least expected. Let the ideas on the left inspire you! |

Benefits of this approach
1. Both interviewer and candidate can get a sense of what it would be like to work together

## Flaws
1. Biased towards particular work styles. For example, Fizz Buzz may fail to highlight the skills of someone who does their best work independently.
2. Interviewer skill has an exaggerated effect on the outcome of the exercise
